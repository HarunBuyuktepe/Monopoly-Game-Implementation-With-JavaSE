Monopoly-Game-Implementation-With-JavaSE

In fifth semester of CSE3063 Object-Oriented Software Design course, we developed with a group of three. I was a project manager.
It was a Monopoly game with increasing functionality was added at each iteration. We implemented it as a simulation in which the simulated players plays the game for a max number of iterations and prints the status of each players actions to the system user.
Last version of the game abstracts all features of the real monopoly game.This project was developed with JAVA SE.
